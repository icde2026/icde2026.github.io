  <h3 style="color: #366598;">Notes on Research Papers</h3>
  <div class="elementor-widget-container">
    <p>Manuscripts <b> must be prepared in</b> accordance with the IEEE format available at <a
        href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.</p>
    <p>Research papers <b>must not exceed 12 pages</b> not including the references. <b>No appendix is allowed</b>.
      Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.</p>

    <p>A paper submitted to ICDE 2026 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire
      time it is considered for ICDE 2026, and it must be substantially different from any previously published
      work.</p>

    <p>A paper submitted to ICDE 2026 must present original work not described in any prior publication that is more
      than 4 double-column pages in length. A prior publication is a paper that has been accepted for presentation
      at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or an article that has been accepted for publication in
      a refereed journal. If an ICDE 2026 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite
      the prior publication, along with all other relevant published work, even if this prior publication is at or
      below the 4-page length threshold.</p>
    <p>Any author of ICDE 2026 should not be a co-author of more than 10 submitted research papers across the two
      submission rounds.</p>
    <p>Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Submissions that are rejected in the first round of
      the IEEE ICDE 2026 research track are not eligible for re-submission to the second round.</p>
    <p>The best papers (as judged by the ICDE 2026 PC) will be selected for submission as an extended version to be
      published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE).</p>
    <p><b>IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution (e.g., remove it from IEEE Xplore) after the
        conference if none of the authors attend the conference to present their paper.</b></p>
    
    <p>Paper should be submitted using the Conference Management Tool <a

  <h3 style="color: #366598;">Industrial Track Submission Guidelines</h3>
      <div class="elementor-widget-container">
        <p>Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE format</a>, and submitted to the ICDE 2026 Industrial Track
          submission website: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDEIndustrial2026">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDEIndustrial2026</a>.</p>
        <p>Long papers must not exceed 12 pages plus unlimited space for references, and short papers must not exceed 6
          pages plus unlimited space for references. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.
          Papers that do not follow the guidelines or are not within the scope of topics relevant to ICDE will be desk
          rejected. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need clarification regarding
          the suitability of their work to this track.</p>
        <p>A paper submitted to ICDE 2026 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire
          time it is considered for ICDE 2026, and it must be substantially different from any previously published
          work.</p>
        <p>Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Each submission must include all author names and
          affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted. In case an exceptional
          situation arises necessitating a change in the author list, the situation needs to be explained via email to
          the industrial track chairs, who will decide whether to approve the change.</p>
        <p>All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from
          distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if none of the authors attends the
          conference to present their paper.</p>

        style="border-left: solid; border-left-color: rgb(178 34 34); padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(178 34 34);">
        <p>ICDE research track submissions that don't meet the following requirements may be rejected without review.
        </p>
        <p>Submissions must follow the aforementioned <b>guidelines</b> and <b>length</b> requirements specified in the
          ICDE 2026 Call for Papers.</p>
        <p>Submissions <b>must be in scope</b> of ICDE 2026. Specifically, this means that <b>a submission must align
            with at least one of the above topic areas</b> defined for ICDE 2026 and <b>situate itself within the state
            of the art of current and past research in the database community in general and within the selected
            topic(s) in particular</b>. For example, submissions that purely advance machine learning approaches not
          relating to any data management aspects (e.g. scalability and efficiency) would be considered as not in scope
          of ICDE.</p>
        <p>Authors <b> must correctly declare all conflicts of interest (COI) </b> with members of the program
          committee. Both, not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs, count as a violation of this
          requirement. The exact definition of a COI is specified in the ICDE 2026 Call for Papers.</p>
        <p>It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the
          Program Committee (Area Chairs and PC members) prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared
          conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.</p>
        <p>With stricter COI rules than before, we understand that finding COIs with a large review board requires
          considerable extra effort. To facilitate this process, we provide a&nbsp;<a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hq3c3yJlMHIwtxi9YVVAo2QUG4244He3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102399911708936057230&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">searchable spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;of COIs (based on DBLP data) with the review
          board.</p>
        <p>Authors can use this spreadsheet as a resource when declaring COIs during submission. It is not meant to be
          authoritative or cover all types of COIs, so authors must still do their due diligence to identify and declare
          COIs missing from the list. This spreadsheet may be updated during the year as well, so please be sure to
          check prior to every submission.</p>
        <p>Searchable spreadsheet with COIs for authors’ convenience:&nbsp;<a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hq3c3yJlMHIwtxi9YVVAo2QUG4244He3/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102399911708936057230&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">searchable spreadsheet</a>.</p>
        <p>After a paper is accepted, the set of authors cannot be changed.</p>
        <p>Submissions that were desk rejected in Round 1 due to COI violations, failure to follow length and formatting
          instructions, or being out of scope for ICDE may be resubmitted in Round 2. The responsibility rests with the
          authors to ensure their paper meets all submission requirements.</p>
        <p><b>Conflict declaration on CMT:<br></b></p>
        <p>In order to declare COIs in CMT, each author of a submission must create a CMT profile and complete it with
          domain and individual conflicts. If a CMT profile is missing for at least one author of a submission, the
          paper will be desk rejected.</p>
        <p>You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting “Domain
          Conflicts” and “Individual Conflicts”. An author’s declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of
          their submissions.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3 style="color: #366598;">Reviewing Process</h3>
      <div class="elementor-widget-container">
        <p><span style="text-align: start;font-weight: bold">Review Quality</span><span style="text-align: start">: ICDE
            2026 papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper. The review process will be
            coordinated by the meta reviewer resulting in one of the decisions to either accept, reject, or revise the
            submission. A meta review will be provided based on the discussions about the paper. Paper revisions will go
            through an additional round of reviews before a final decision is made to accept or reject the paper.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: start"><span style="font-weight: bold">Revisions</span>: Papers will be invited to submit
          a revised version of their paper if the PC believes the papers can reasonably be improved within the allocated
          revision time frame. Authors will have five weeks to prepare their revisions. The revision process is intended
          to be a constructive interaction between reviewers and authors.</p>
      </div>

      <br><br>
      <h3 style="color: #366598;">Inclusions and Diversity in Writing</h3>
      <div class="elementor-widget-container">
        <p>We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Both are important in our writing as well.
          Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping,
          or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs)
          in computing. Also be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples. Reviewers will be
          empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising
          the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible
          avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community’s diversity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br><br>
      <h3 style="color: #366598;">Conflict of Interest</h3>
      <div class="elementor-widget-container">
        <p>During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about Conflicts of
          Interest (COI) of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of
          all authors of a paper to identify all (and only) PC members with potential COIs as per the definition
          provided here. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are
          subject to immediate rejection.</p>
        <p><b>Definition of Conflict of Interest (COI):</b></p>
        <p>An <b>author X</b> of an ICDE 2026 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if and only if
          one or more of the following conditions hold:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>X is a co-author of another ICDE 2026 submission together with Y.</li>
          <li>X is a co-author of Y in a publication in the past three years.</li>
          <li>X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.</li>
          <li>X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.</li>
          <li>X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).</li>
          <li>X is or was Y's primary thesis advisor or vice versa, no matter how long ago.</li>
          <li>X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs
            for a submission to be considered for review.</b></p>
